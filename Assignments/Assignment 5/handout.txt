Templetize class Rational from the previous assignment.

Assume that class T (the template parameter) can do all required arithmetic:
addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. 

Friend function stream insertion requires some extra work. Since it is a 
template friend of a class template, we need a second template parameter 
U to be able to declare it. 

Take a look at the skeleton to see how static data is initialized (width).
