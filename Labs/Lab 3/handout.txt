For this week's lab, you will take your previous lab implementations for a
linked list and create a class out of them. 

Implement all of the methods in a file called List.cpp. (Notice the
capitalization.) You'll have to remove some methods. For example, since
you now have a destructor, you need to remove the FreeList method (or make it
private, if you still wish to use it from your destructor).
