In this lab you will write a few simple functions to manipulate a singly-linked
list. There are 7 functions, but two are already provided for you. Remember to
keep your code from this lab as you will add to it in the coming weeks. Also,
be sure to draw diagrams to help you understand what you are trying to do.
If you need a refresher on linked lists - use CS120 link posted on course 
web-site.

Note:
This is a fairly simple lab and is somewhat similar to a CS120 lab that some of
you did. (Even the Node structure was the same.) However, you can't just simply
resubmit what you did in CS120 because you are going to be modifying things and
using C++-style code. Also, *** the next 4 labs will be built from this lab***,    <<<<< !!!!!
so make sure you do this correctly. If you need a refresher from CS120,
you can find the linked-list notes here that I discussed on Friday during
the extra linked-list lecture last week.
